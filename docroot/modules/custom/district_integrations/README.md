# District Integrations

This module serves as a consistent approach for external integrations to register themselves.
It provides an admin page listing integrations by type and the status of the integration.

## Create additional plugins

See `district_integrations_examples` for example integrations. 

## TODO

Add lots more documentation and best practice for new integrations.
